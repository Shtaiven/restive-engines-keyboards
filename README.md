# shockboard

## Introduction

The shockboard is a split columnar-staggered keyboard inspired by boards such as the CRKBD (corne), Lily58, Sofle, and others. It is designed based on my own finger positions, with a thumb cluster that is comfortable for my smaller hands while resting in what I consider a neutral position. A monoblock design has been chosen easy portability and setup.

## Building the keyboard

The repository contains `pcbs/{revision}/fabrication` directory containing pcb fabrication files for each keyboard revision.
