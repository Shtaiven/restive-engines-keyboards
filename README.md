# shockboard: small-hands columnar keyboard (SHCKB)

## Introduction

The shockboard is a split columnar-staggered keyboard inspired by boards such as the CRKBD (corne), Lily58, Kyria, *dox, and others. It is designed based on my own finger positions, with a thumb cluster that is comfortable for my smaller hands while resting in what I consider a neutral position.
